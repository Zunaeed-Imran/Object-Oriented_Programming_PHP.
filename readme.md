## OPP Practice (Object_Oriented_Programming)
- first we take a class with a name of the class
- than we take public variable in this class
- after that we take function 
- in function we use `$this->variable` 
- than out side class and out side function 
- we take a new variable `=  new  class_name()`
- than we give value of the public variable 
- than echo it by call out side variable name and function name `outside_variable->function_variable();`
